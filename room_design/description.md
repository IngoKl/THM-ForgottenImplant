## Task Description

*Objective:* Get user access to the server and escalate privileges.

Welcome to **Forgotten Implant**!

This is a pretty straightforward CTF-like room in which you will have to get initial access before elevating your privileges. The initial attack surface is quite limited, and you'll have to find a way of interacting with the system.

If you have no prior knowledge of Command and Control (C2), you might want to look at the [Intro to C2](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtoc2) room. While it is not necessary to solve this challenge, it will provide valuable context for your learning experience.

Please allow 3-5 minutes for the VM to boot properly!

*Note:* While being very linear, this room can be solved in various ways. To get the most out of it, feel free to overengineer your solution to your liking!
